Pytest is a software testing framework.
    - meaning it is a command-line tool that automatically finds tests youâ€™ve written, 
        runs the tests, and reports the results.

Run
    pytest  # searches in local dir
    pytest <test>.py
    pytest test_1.py test_2.py
    pytest <test>.py::method
    pytest <test>.py::TestClass::method
    pytest dir  
    --tb=no # with no traceback

Test Discovery
    - Pass to pytest file, directory or specific test within a file.
    - Naming convention
        - Test file should be named test_<something>.py or <something>_test.py
        - Methods and functions should be named test_<something>
        - Test classes should be named Test<Something>

    * To explicitly fail a test, pytest.fail() could be used.
