Kafka
	Event Streaming is the practise of capturing data in real-time from event sources 
		in the form of streams of events, storing them durably for later retrieval; 
		routing the events to another destination.

	Apache Kafka is an event streaming platform.


	Kafka (Basic)
		publish(write) and subsribe to (read) streams of events
		store stream of events 
		process streams of events as they occur

		Client & Server setup (communicate via TCP)
		Server 
			Servers used as data storage (brokers) or Kafka connect (in-memory type)
		Clients
			Producers - client applications that publish events to Kafka 
			Consumers - client applications that subsribe to those events in Kafka. 

		Topics - Events are organized in topics. (similar to folders, and events are files)
		Paritions - a topic is spread over number of "buckets" located on different brokers.
