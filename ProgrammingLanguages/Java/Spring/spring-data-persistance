Sprint Data JPA
    - makes use of interfaces which have automatic implementation at runtime.
    - the repository provides interfaces which we can extend. the data JPA framework will handle implementation.

    - To extend the repository, we also need to make our model JPA entity.
        - must have @Entity
        - must have @Id on id
        - must have empty contructor

    - Implementation
        - At runtime, Spring Injects a JDK dynamic proxy for the beans that extend the Repository interface
        - The proxy implementation intercepts the repository interface method calls and delegates them to a generic underlying implementation.

    - DataAccessException Hierarchy
        - NonTransientDataAccessException
        - TransientDataAccessException
        - RecoverableDataAccessException
        - ScriptException

- H2
    - If we use the default configuration, Spring Boot will search for entities and create the respective tables automatically on startup.
    - However, sometimes we want to have more control over the database creation process, and that's when we can make use of the data.sql and schema.sql files.
        - spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none // if you use this option
