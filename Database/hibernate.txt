Hibernate ORM enables developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process.
** Implementation of JPA specification.
** JPA itself is just a specification, not a product; it cannot perform persistence or anything else by itself. JPA is just a set of interfaces, and requires an implementation
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database

Spring App > JDBC > JPA > DB 

JDBC - is the JavaSoft specification of a standard application programming interface (API) that allows Java programs to access database management systems.
** The JDBC API defines the Java interfaces and classes that programmers use to connect to databases and send queries. 
** A JDBC driver implements these interfaces and classes for a particular DBMS vendor.

DAO - isolate the application/business layer from the persistence layer (usually a relational database but could be any other persistence mechanism) using an abstract API
